First victory on my First Hackathon!

Hackathon ‚ùå free T-shirts & sticker-thon ‚úÖ 

Mid-night Frozen, late-night face masks, seeing men (referring to males), women (referring to females), seniors (referring to Senior and Graduate students), and freshmen (referring to First Year Freshman) wearing face masks wandering around like ghosts.

The first Hackathon project I participated in was an AI writing helper. I really, really want to write a book (and have prepared quite a bit for it), and I always felt that the tools available were lacking. So, I created my own writing tool! But the idea isn't to let AI write the book, but to have AI handle the redundant tasks while I focus on writing the book, typing each word myself.

Since I had actually written a book, during the demo, I showed off my vast and intricate settings, which amazed each judge.

I won't go into too much detail about the project, but it was successful, and I received strong support from my teammates.

+ I experienced prompt engineering in depth

+ Every idea I proposed was approved by my teammates

+ All teammates had great personalities

During the demo, due to the lack of time, the judge said, "I'll only give you 30 seconds," and I felt like I was about to lose it.

At the beginning, I shouted out (because the environment was noisy), "AI-written words have no soul!" The 30 seconds were up, and the judge didn't have time to listen further, but suddenly, he took out his business card and said he was very interested because he was also an author and agreed with what I said! The whole team was shocked.

After my teammates took pictures with the business card and handed it to me solemnly, my feelings were indescribable. It was overwhelming to win three awards in my first competition (scratching my head), and I even lay down on the sofa, getting up three times.

The two sponsor awards were particularly surprising, as I never expected my idea to attract the attention of business investors! (Thankfully, I did market research while preparing for the competition late at night)

Another award was for my teammate who secured a fancy domain name (not Saga). Initially, I thought I would have to pull an all-nighter, so I drank four or five cans of Monster (plus one in the morning) and a can of Red Bull.

However, I still fell asleep around 4:30 am and woke up at 6:30 am.

Ahem, a team's strongest state is when it's unclear who leads whom because everyone's presence is essential. Ranking in the top ten overall in this competition is undoubtedly impressive! But it will make me more ambitious next time [Doge] (it's a pity we didn't make it to the top five; I had my eyes on that Switch Lite, ahem).

Me: (to no one) Did you know? There's a limit to one's ability in computer science.

No one: So what?

Me: So, I've decided to start a business! (I still need to study computer science, and I still need to do my assignments...) The project will definitely continue, and I already have ideas for starting a business!
