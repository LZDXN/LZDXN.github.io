  If we speculate based on this rule, the absolute fixed coordinate system does not exist? Or is it that the above assumptions are not valid and all concepts of movement are only relative?

I suddenly have a question
What are the rules for movement (in the real world)?

Is it a refresh system like a computer?
In this case, if we go from point A to point B, will we be erased first at point A, and then created at point B at the same time to form a continuity?

Is it transmitted through ripples?
Like sound waves, they pass through one medium to another medium, but the route formed is invisible, or appears in the form of instant "appearance" and "disappearance" (such as the "trajectory" of electrons)

In the final analysis, these transmission rules must have a fixed system/reference system. Are these reference systems eternal? If they change, should they also follow the above rules and have a corresponding fixed coordinate system?

If we speculate based on this rule, the absolute fixed coordinate system does not exist? Or is it that the above assumptions are not valid and all concepts of movement are only relative?

So the word "moving" exists forever, but "stationary" does not exist forever?
