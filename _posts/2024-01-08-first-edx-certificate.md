(Should be) the first edx certificate?
I have always used cousera for free.
I’ve been fishing too much these days and I’m thinking of doing something during the holidays.

This course is mainly to learn about the API of Hugging Face. I have always wanted to read the doc and the result has been delayed, so I went through the doc for the reason of getting a certificate.!

I really have to complain about this lab. If you press start lab during the dataset download process, it will not only interrupt the task, but also skip the task when you re-run the code because the dataset folder has been created (the actual data has not been downloaded). ) caused me to spend an hour and a half just debugging in this lab (it was a problem with the setup of the lab, not a problem with my code)
As a result, in the end I directly deleted all the dataset folders and downloaded them from the beginning (the time ratio was extremely high)

At least 24 years have made a good start


1 + 1 = 3(?)

This extra certificate is Professional Certification. Two certifications must be completed at the same time to get a professional certificate (usually more than two courses)

Facts have proved that you cannot set up flags randomly. If you set up a flag, you must give a reason that makes it difficult to remove the flag.

The last time I sent a certificate, someone asked me how much the course certificate cost. Then I took a look and found that I bought it at the original price... (Scholarship 90% off)
Then I remembered the reason why I bought it at the original price, because I had to finish this course, so I wanted to give myself a reason that was hard to give up... and then... I finished it before I got busy at the start of school.

As for the start of school? The start of school has opened up a new pit, so I won’t talk about it for now or it will be embarrassing if I don’t finish it.

Although, these two courses are very interesting, the overall difficulty is not difficult, and you need to have a certain understanding of Python's API and data processing (this one uses pytorch)
