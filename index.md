At the heart of my academic pursuits at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, lies a deep-rooted passion for technology and innovation. My journey is not just about building a robust technical foundation in programming and data analysis but also about weaving these skills into the fabric of my personal interests and aspirations.

As I've navigated my coursework at WashU, I've seen my abilities in Python, Julia, Java, and C flourish. My proficiency in developer tools and cloud technologies has grown in tandem, further enhanced by engaging in hands-on research, tackling complex data processing challenges, and managing intricate infrastructures.


Outside the realms of academia, I find solace and excitement in writing. As a budding novelist, I am currently working on a fantasy novel in Chinese, with over 20,000 words already penned down. This creative endeavor reflects not only my love for storytelling but also my keen interest in exploring new-world settings and intricate plot developments. However, the challenges of maintaining consistency and integrating new ideas into an evolving storyline led me to conceive the idea for a saga - a project that triumphed at the HackDartmouth event, winning three awards including the prestigious Contrary Capital sponsored prize. This recognition is not just a testament to the project's innovation but also a stepping stone in my journey as an entrepreneur.

As I gain more experience at WashU and delve deeper into the startup ecosystem, my resolve to work in a startup environment has only strengthened. I see myself as an AI technical founder and data scientist, driven by the core values of freedom and free will. I aspire to merge my technical expertise with my narrative flair, aiming to make writing more approachable and accessible for everyone. In this fusion of technology and creativity, I seek to carve a unique path that resonates with my personal and professional ethos.
